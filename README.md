## UX

### Project goals

This project has the main goal of informing customers of our new delivery service. It also has the goal of attracting new customers to the shop as well as trying to keep existing custmers returning.
This is to be done through a simple, easy to navigate website with all the information about the shops and products
the owner has requested.

### Business goals

The owner of Dans Doughnuts has stated what information he would like on the site. He is new to the online world and has
requested that all shop locations with addresses and phone numbers are to be easy to find. He wants the delivery service to be advertised.
He has also requested for the flavours to be put on.
He has stated that he would like to reward customers if we can to give them a sense of value from returning to the shop and also
advertise for extra business opportunities like festivals or private events to advertise brand name more.

### Customer goals

After reaching out to a few customers its very clear to see they enjoy the product and quite regularly return.
Despite being quite happy with the product and service they deserve to be able to access more value if possible.
They also need to find out more about Dans Doughnuts as well as be able to quickly show friends the website.
This should include finding locations, flavours and any deals for discount.

### Developer goals

I am a fan of this product so I will devise a way to give more value to the customer as well as getting details from some of these
customers so that Dans Doughnuts can advertise new discounts and deals to keep the customers coming back.
I agree with the business owner that the website should be easy to navigate and easy to read as there is such a range of age of customers that
it must be clear to a 10 yr old as well as a 88 yr old.

### User stories

### Design choices

For my design choices I will try to capture the colours of the sprinkles on the doughnuts and use them within the website.
There are lots of colours from the doughnuts and I wanted to keep it that way as then they stand out more.
For the background I have chosen an off white which will help the text colour to blend in with the rest of the website. The text color I
will keep neutral as much as I can again just to emphasise the doughnut pictures. I will keep the website clean and not too cluttered as well as
have similar theme and layout so away from the main page customers will find it easy to navigate with the natural order/flow of
the website quite clear. I will do this by having a fixed clear navigation bar available as you scroll down to link to different pages.
I will also make two forms, one to sign up for an email newsletter to capture email addresses to advertise to and one for a contact about
possible business opportunities like private events.

## Features

### Existing features

At the moment we have multiple pages on the site. The main page will consist of sign up hero banner with button and overlay text. Then underneath
there will be another quick link to find locations and flavours available. These are the fundamentals asked for, what and where plus value to return.
There will be a page for full addresses and two more pages for the sign up form and contact form.

### Future features

Once the owner has begun to understand the online world I feel this business would benefit from more social media presence. This could come in short videos
about offers or getting involved within the community like sponsoring a sports team or donation to a worthwhile cause. I have already spoke at length about
the benefit of setting up an online delivery service which will happen at the owners discretion once he feels the Dublin store can run fully without help.
With that could come a make your own style doughnuts with any combination of sprinkles and flavours which I am really exicied about.

## Technologies used

For this website I have chosen just to start out with HTML and CSS. When future features are developed I will add javascript along with bootstrap.
